# Robo Advisor

A robo advisor is a service that automatically balance an investorâ€™s portfolio. It makes decisions based on basic information and investing goals. The Nigerian robo advisor built in this assessment helps an investor to decide on how to split their portfolio into different available stocks based on a risk score / tolerance selected.
